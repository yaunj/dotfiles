Miscellaneous dotfiles
======================

This repository contains various dotfiles I might need on more than one machine.

Previously, this repository contained my [Vim configuration][vim-config] and
[Zsh configuration][zsh-config] as submodules, but this it not the case any
more.

Install with GNU stow: `stow -R -t ~ --ignore README.md .`

[vim-config]: https://github.com/yaunj/vim-config
[zsh-config]: https://github.com/yaunj/zsh-config/
